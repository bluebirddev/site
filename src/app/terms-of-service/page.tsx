            </p>
            <p>
                These Terms incorporate by reference our Privacy Policy, as well as any other
                written policies and documentation that we may provide from time to time. You agree
                to use our Services in compliance with these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your use of our Services in any manner means that you agree to the Terms.

            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>
                Bluebird believes that conversational AI will fundamentally reshape the way that we
                interact and use computers in our everyday lives. As you interact with our Services,
                we will learn more about how to make this emerging technology ever more helpful,
                collaborative, and fun to communicate with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the early stage of this technology, we also acknowledge that there are areas
                that we will need to continually improve on to make sure that our Services can reach
                their full potential. As part of that, you recognize that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We will use the content of your conversations to improve our Services. We will
                    use the content of your conversations as well as other metadata to train our
                    models, improve our Services, and create new Services. Our uses of this data are
                    detailed in our Privacy Policy.

                <li>
                    You must use our Services following our Acceptable Use policy. Your access to

                    generally and our Acceptable Use Policy (as detailed below in “Acceptable Use”).

                    otherwise trustworthy. Do not rely on this information without fact-checking on
                    your own first or consulting with a professional. Getting factuality right
                    remains an active area of research for the entire field of conversational AI,
                    and it remains a major priority for the development of Bluebird services going
                    forward. Please review the “No Warranties” section below.

                messages you send or receive. Message frequency may vary. Your carrier may prohibit
                or restrict certain mobile features and certain mobile features may be incompatible
                with your carrier or mobile device. We are not liable for any delays in the receipt
                of, or any failures to receive, any calls, text messages, SMS, or MMS messages, as
                delivery is subject to effective transmission by your mobile carrier and
                compatibility of your mobile device. Please contact your mobile carrier if you have
                any questions regarding these issues or your mobile data and messaging plan.
                Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

                change over time. Bluebird may augment, modify, discontinue, or suspend any part of
                our Services at any time. We will work to provide advance notice to you where
                appropriate, but you acknowledge that this may not always be possible.
            </p>
            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
                Bluebird reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time for any reason. We will

                updating the effective date. No other amendments to the Terms shall be effective
                unless in writing and signed by you and a representative of Bluebird. The use of any
                of our Services after such an amendment to the Terms shall be considered an
                acceptance of all changes to the Terms. If you do not agree with the revised Terms,

                <li>
                    Choice of Law: These Terms are governed by and will be construed under
                    applicable federal law and the laws of the State of California, without regard
                    to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

                    in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial
                    Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one

                    other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.

                    respectively, Santa Clara County, California, or the Northern District of
                    California. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding arising out of
                    these Terms will be entitled to an award of costs and attorneys’ fees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Class Action Waiver: To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Bluebird
                    agree that all claims against the other can only be brought in an individual
                    capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
                    consolidated, or other representative proceeding. We agree that arbitrators may
                    not conduct any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding, and are
                    limited to providing relief warranted by an individual party’s claim.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Waiver: The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right
                    herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notices: Notices under these Terms shall be provided to you under the

                </li>
                <li>
                    Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or
                    invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent

                    understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
