                Aurora was initially built by another development company. They lacked adaptability
                which resulted in an unmaintainable code base. We were initially tasked only to
                finish the original MVP, but it soon became clear that we had to re-write
                everything. The original project ran for more than one year, and we rebuilt it in
                three months.
